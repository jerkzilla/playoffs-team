# See https://help.github.com/articles/ignoring-files for more about ignoring files.
#
# If you find yourself ignoring temporary files generated by your text editor
# or operating system, you probably want to add a global ignore instead:
#   git config --global core.excludesfile '~/.gitignore_global'

# Ignore bundler config.
/playoffs-team-backend/.bundle

# Ignore all logfiles and tempfiles.
/playoffs-team-backend/log/*
/playoffs-team-backend/tmp/*
!/playoffs-team-backend/log/.keep
!/playoffs-team-backend/tmp/.keep

# Ignore pidfiles, but keep the directory.
/playoffs-team-backend/tmp/pids/*
!/playoffs-team-backend/tmp/pids/
!/playoffs-team-backend/tmp/pids/.keep

# Ignore uploaded files in development.
/playoffs-team-backend/storage/*
!/playoffs-team-backend/storage/.keep
/playoffs-team-backend.byebug_history

# Ignore master key for decrypting credentials and more.
/playoffs-team-backend/config/master.key
/playoffs-team-backend/.env
